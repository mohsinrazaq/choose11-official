            <h3>Use of Cookies:</h3>
            <p>
                To improve the effectiveness and usability of the App and Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number, which is known as a User Identification (User ID). This
                is done to understand the User's individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration), Choose11 has no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer.
                The only personal information a cookie contains is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their
                ad banners), a process that Choose11 does not control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose11's web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit the App or Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet
                know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Choose11 uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its
                App and Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the App and Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Choose11's visitors come.
            </p>
            <h3>Links:</h3>
            <p>
                Choose11 also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Choose11's control. Once the User leaves our servers (the User can tell the same by checking the URL in the location bar
                on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site, which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Choose11's own. If the User can't find the privacy
                policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information. Choose11 will not be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
            </p>
            <h3> Security Procedures:</h3>
            <p>

                we understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being
                transmitted to us over the Internet. Furthermore, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with Internet access. In using the App and Portal, you understand and agree that your information
                may be used in or transferred to countries other than Pakistan.

            <p>
                Choose11 also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium. We may periodically review from time to time and change our privacy policy to incorporate such future changes as may be considered appropriate, without any notice to the Users. Our use
                of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page, so you are always
